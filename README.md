Fantasy Basketball Game
This is a Python program that allows users to draft NBA players to their teams and compete against each other based on the players' real-world statistics. The program scrapes player data from the NBA website, allows users to draft players to their teams through a graphical user interface, simulates games based on real-world statistics, and stores the results in a text file.
